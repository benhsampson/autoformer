There are several key items that investors will be keeping an eye on during this announcement. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts and analysts across the industry to break down the most important things to know. Kineo Capital Managing Partner Jim Strugger broke down a potential option trade for investors to watch based on Apple earnings. Strugger explained, \"The outcome we're structuring for is for the stock to move very little after earnings ... really taking advantage of pumped up implied volatility and selling that to the people that believe that Apple could move very sharply either up or down.\" Yahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley discussed all of the details of Apple's new products and how they may impact earnings. Howley said, \"They did announce some new chips and some new laptops, as well as a new iMac ... For the current quarter that's about to be reported though, Apple sales for laptops supposed to be lower, for desktops supposed to be lower. Overall, it looks as though this is going to help improve the Mac revenue. We just have to see how much of an impact it has.\" Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin also discussed Apple's new product line and some of the challenges that Apple is facing ahead of earnings. Bajarin noted, \"They are up against some supply constraints, particularly as they're moving to a new process technology for the high end iPhones ... looking at ASPs and gross margins will be very telling about if that new buyer base is skewing toward the higher end, which is what I think has been the trend over the last couple years.\" Video highlights: 00:00:03 - Kineo Capital Managing Partner Jim Strugger 00:00:40 - Yahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley 00:01:14 - Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin",
